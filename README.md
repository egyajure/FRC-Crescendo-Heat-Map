# FRC Crescendo Shot Tracker
The FRC Crescendo Shot Tracker is a Unity app developed with the intention of tracking FRC robot accuracy during matches by representing shots in color-coded data maps.

Functionality:
 - view shot tracking map based on percentage, number of hits, and number of misses
 - save, load, and delete tracking maps
 - swipe-based UX to make shot tracker easy to use during matches

# Potential improvements
- Add in functionality to undo a shot if you misswipe
- Represent shots in more of a heat-map manner
- Increase size of the mesh to allow for slight inaccuracies in swiping
